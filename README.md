# DXBallBoardUnlocker
This is a small reverse engineering project of DX-Ball 2 (specifically, the 20th Anniversary Edition) that I did for fun (and to impress a friend).
It is capable of decrypting board sets and removing their password protection if there is any (such as with the ones that ship with the game).
I'm not sure who this will be useful to, but it's here for those who need it!
